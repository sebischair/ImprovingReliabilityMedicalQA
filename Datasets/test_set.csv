1,A patient with prostate cancer has just completed definitive local therapy. What types of support should clinicians offer to help with symptom management and overall well-being?,"Clinicians should support patients through continued symptom management and encourage engagement with professional or community-based resources. Support can include referrals to social work services, local and national prostate cancer support groups, dietary and nutrition services, physical therapists, pelvic floor rehabilitation specialists, and psychosexual therapists. Peer support should also be offered to address the broad array of survivorship needs.",AUA_ASTRO II.pdf, 
2,A patient with localized prostate cancer is undergoing external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). What measures should be taken to optimize the therapeutic ratio of EBRT?,"Clinicians should utilize available target localization, normal tissue avoidance, simulation procedures (like bladder/rectum filling instructions, patient immobilization, placement of fiducial markers, use of rectal spacers), advanced treatment planning/delivery (e.g. integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), and image-guidance procedures (e.g. cone beam CTs) to optimize the therapeutic ratio of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) delivered for prostate cancer. A variety of approaches exist to optimize the ther- apeutic ratio in radiation oncology. ",AUA_ASTRO III.pdf, 
3,A prostate carcinoma patient undergoing a transperineal prostate biopsy is concerned about pain management. What are the different anesthesia options available for this procedure?,For pain management during a transperineal prostate biopsy several local anesthesia options are available: Ultrasound-guided peri-prostatic block is generally recommended.  It should be noticed that the transperineal approach significantly increased patient pain compared to a transrectal biopsy approach. Two alternatives include: pudendal block and  perineal nerve block. A combination of peri-prostatic and pudendal block anaesthesia reduced pain during transperineal biopsies compared to peri-prostatic anaesthesia only. Perineal nerve-block was superior for the relief of pain during the biopsy procedure versus periprostatic block.,EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG-Guidelines-on-Prostate-Cancer-2024_2024-04-09-132035_ypmy_2024-04-16-122605_lqpk.pdf,

19,"A 70-year-old man with localized prostate cancer do not wants to be treated with either surgery or radiotherapy. However, he is not keen on whole-gland treatment due to potential side effects. What alternative treatment approach might he consider and what are its benefits?","He might consider focal therapy, which aims to ablate only the region of the prostate containing the tumor, thereby limiting toxicity by sparing the neurovascular bundles, sphincter, and urethra. HIFU and focal photodynamic therapy (PDT) are favoured for theirtoxicitiy data, with over 95% of pad-free incontinence and 85–90% of patients without clinically significant cancer in short-term analysis. Definitive proof of oncological effectiveness of focal therapy compared to standard treatments remains unavailable, which is why focal therapy with HIFU or cryotherapy should be offered within a clinical trial or prospective registry.",EAU-EANM-ESTRO-ESUR-ISUP-SIOG-Guidelines-on-Prostate-Cancer-2024_2024-04-09-132035_ypmy_2024-04-16-122605_lqpk.pdf,

Detailed surgical and pathological reports are required, and the borders of residual skin should be determined in conjunction with the surgeon and marked before planning CT scanning. The CTV should include residual subcutaneous glandular tissue and the subcutaneous lymphatics, but not the skin unless the cancer stage is T4b, T4c, or T4d.

57,A patient with pN1 breast cancer treated with mastectomy and axillary dissection is scheduled for PMRT. What evidence supports the use of PMRT in this context?,The use of PMRT in patients with pN1 breast cancer treated with mastectomy and axillary dissection is supported by evidence showing that PMRT reduces recurrences and breast cancer mortality. ,Contouring_ESTRO-postmastectomy_RT_after_implant-based_reconstruction.pdf, 
58,A patient with early-stage breast cancer is considering immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy. She is concerned about the risk of complications associated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy. How does the type of reconstruction (implant-based vs. autologous flap-based) impact the risk of complications?,"Studies have shown that PMRT in the setting of reconstruction can increase the relative rate of complications regardless of the type of reconstruction. However, fewer complications and better long-term cosmetic outcomes have been reported with autologous flap-based reconstruction compared to implant-based reconstruction (IBR). Specifically, implant-based IBR has approximately 2.64 times higher odds of complications than autologous flap-based reconstruction. The rates of reconstruction failure at two years are 18.7% for patients with implant-based IBR versus 1% for those with autologous reconstruction.",Contouring_ESTRO-postmastectomy_RT_after_implant-based_reconstruction.pdf, 
59,A radiation oncologist is planning PMRT for a patient with a retro-pectoral implant after mastectomy. What specific considerations should be made for delineating the CTV in this scenario?,"When planning PMRT for a patient with a retro-pectoral implant, the CTV should include the tissue ventral to the major pectoral muscle and the implant, except at the medial, lateral, and caudal borders where it may extend to the ventral side of the chest wall not covered by the pre-surgical extension of the major pectoral muscle. The implant itself can largely be excluded from the CTV. If there are adverse factors or if the tumor was close to the dorsal fascia, the tissue between the chest wall and the implant caudal from the pre-surgical position of the major pectoral muscle should be included as a separate dorsal CTV. Surgical clips placed to mark the primary tumor site and the pre-surgical muscle insertion can aid in accurate delineation.",Contouring_ESTRO-postmastectomy_RT_after_implant-based_reconstruction.pdf, 
60,"During a multidisciplinary tumor board meeting, a case is presented where a patient underwent pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer. What are the guidelines for delineating the CTV in such a case?","For a patient with a pre-pectoral implant-based reconstruction, the CTV consists of two parts: the ventral part between the skin and the implant, and the dorsal part between the implant and the pectoral muscle/chest wall. The ventral part should include the subcutaneous lymphatic plexus and any residual glandular tissue, typically up to 3-5 mm under the skin surface. The dorsal part, which includes the tissue between the implant and the chest wall, should be included only if there are adverse tumor factors, such as large primary breast cancer (pT3), locally advanced breast cancer with non-pathological complete response to primary systemic therapy, or invasion of the major pectoral muscle and/or chest wall.",Contouring_ESTRO-postmastectomy_RT_after_implant-based_reconstruction.pdf,
