1,A 60-year-old man with a strong family history of breast and prostate cancer is newly diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer. What additional assessments should be considered?,"Clinicians should perform an assessment of patient and tumor risk factors to guide the decision to offer germline testing. This includes evaluating mutations known to be associated with aggressive prostate cancer and/or known to have implications for treatment. Examples of relevant genes include ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 and others.",AUA_ASTRO I.pdf, 
2,A patient with prostate cancer at high risk for metastatic disease has negative conventional imaging results. What additional imaging can be considered?,"For patients at high risk for metastatic disease with negative conventional imaging, clinicians may obtain molecular imaging, such as prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scanning, to evaluate for metastases. This is based on its demonstrated enhanced staging accuracy.",AUA_ASTRO I.pdf, 
3,A patient on active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer is concerned about the frequency of biopsies. How can multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) be utilized in his monitoring?,"For patients selecting active surveillance, clinicians should utilize multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to augment risk stratification, but this should not replace periodic surveillance biopsy. If the initial prostate biopsy was performed without mpMRI guidance and the mpMRI findings are suspicious for clinically significant prostate cancer (PI-RADS 4 or 5), a repeat targeted biopsy is recommended. If mpMRI findings are less suspicious (PI-RADS 1, 2, or 3), a repeat biopsy may be performed within approximately 12 months after diagnosis. ",AUA_ASTRO II.pdf, 
4,A 70-year-old man with clinically localized prostate cancer elects to undergo radical prostatectomy. What considerations should be taken into account regarding nerve-sparing during the surgery?,"In patients electing radical prostatectomy, nerve-sparing should be performed when oncologically appropriate. Preservation of the neurovascular bundles during surgery is associated with a lower likelihood of postoperative erectile dysfunction and improved urinary continence, without significantly compromising the rates of positive surgical margins or biochemical recurrence. The decision to perform nerve-sparing should consider factors such as PSA, DRE, biopsy findings, MRI findings, and the patient's baseline erectile function and prioritization of sexual function. MRI should not be used in isolation to determine nerve-sparing.",AUA_ASTRO II.pdf, 
5,"A patient with prostate cancer ISUP grade 4  with no evidence of lymphatic spread on pelvic MRI  is undergoing radical prostatectomy. Should pelvic lymphadenectomy be performed, and if so, to what extent?","All over there is only limited  prospective clinical trial data for this qustions.  However, existing data suggestes that pelvic lymphadenectomy provides staging information that may guide future management but does not consistently improve metastasis-free, cancer-specific, or overall survival. However, a post-hoc analysis of a recent randomized prospective trial showed  improved biochem- ical recurrence-free survival in patinets with ISUP Grade 3-5. Clinicians should use nomograms to select patients for lymphadenectomy, balancing the potential benefit of identifying lymph node-positive disease with the risk of complications. An extended pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is recommended for appropriately risk-selected patients, as it improves staging accuracy compared to a limited dissection.",AUA_ASTRO II.pdf, 
6,"Following treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer, how often should a patient be monitored with PSA tests and symptom assessments?","Patients should be monitored with PSA tests and symptom assessments every three to six months for the first two years after treatment.

8,A patient with low-risk prostate cancer is considering proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) instead of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). What evidence exists regarding the superiority of PBRT over IMRT?,"To date, no prospective study has demonstrated improved disease control or side effects with proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) compared to IMRT. The existing literature suggests that clinical outcomes, including complications and patient-reported quality of life (QOL), are similar between PBRT and IMRT.",AUA_ASTRO III.pdf, 
9,An elderly patient with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer is considering radiation therapy but is worried about the use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). What does the guideline recommend regarding the use of ADT in this patient population?,"The guideline recommends that clinicians should not routinely use ADT in patients with low- or favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer electing radiation therapy, due to the potential deleterious short- and long-term effects of ADT. Radiotherapeutic monotherapy has shown positive cancer outcomes for this patient population.",AUA_ASTRO III.pdf, 
10,A patient with high-risk prostate cancer is scheduled for radiation therapy and is considering whether to include pelvic lymph node irradiation. What does the guideline suggest about this approach?,"The guideline suggests that clinicians may offer radiation to the pelvic lymph nodes in patients with high-risk prostate cancer. Recent trials have shown improved biochemical failure-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival with whole pelvis IMRT, although no difference was detected in overall survival.",AUA_ASTRO III.pdf, 
11,A 65-year-old patient with low-risk prostate cancer undergoes external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Should androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) be added to his treatment?,"No, additional ADT is not recommended for low-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing EBRT.",ESTRO-ACROP-AHT.pdf,
